#CM Tracker

This application was built to help automate and organize the administrative work
that goes into running a childcare team. 

In addition to helping us keep track of which kids are checked in each week, we
can also see what families are dropping off the map, which services are most busy,
and which families are brand new visitors.

This project is quite internal and no actual child data is captured here on GitHub.
The source code itself is still a worthwhile Rails app and I'm open to hearing any
suggestions.
